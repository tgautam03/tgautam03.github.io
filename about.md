I am *Tushar Gautam*, a graduate of *Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India*, with a masters' degree in Geophysics and love for computers. I'm currently a Graduate Research Assistant at [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](https://www.sci.utah.edu/home.html) and pursuing PhD in Computing at the University of Utah.

### At [IIT Roorkee](https://iitr.ac.in/), 2015-2020
For my Mastersâ€™ Thesis, I worked on *Seismic Velocity Modeling using Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks*.

- I used Finite Difference Modeling to generate
large amounts on synthetic seismic data for training the Machine Learning
Algorithm.
- The trained algorithm then predicted subsurface velocity models
using raw seismic traces.

### At [Optic Earth](https://opticearth.co/), 2019-2020
- In my final year at IIT Roorkee, I also worked with a U.K. based Start-up company named *Optic Earth*.
- During my time there, I worked on building an AI powered Subsurface  Imaging Software stack for Norway based *Neptune Energy*.

### At [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), 2020-2021
A successful academic-cum-research run at IIT Roorkee culminated into a
rewarding opportunity as I got the offer to join the Visiting Student Programme
(virtual due to pandemic) at KAUST.
- I worked on *Tomographic Deconvolution using Deep Neural Networks*.
- I was a TA for the Machine Learning course, *ErSE 290: Machine Learning Methods in geosciences*.

### At [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/), 2021-present
- Pursuing PhD in Computing (Scientific Computing).
- Research Assistant at [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](https://www.sci.utah.edu/home.html).
- Applying Machine Learning methods to problems in Fracture Mechanics
- Understanding and explaining Machine Learning methods from an engineer/mathematician's point of view
- Exploring the concept of data-driven physics-based Digital Twin
